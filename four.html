	<h2 style="text-align: center;"> A Path to Sustainable Development </h2>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 12 in titled “Responsible Consumption and Production” talks about maintaining sustainable patterns of consumption and production is essential for maintaining the standard of living for both present and future generations. The SDG 12 also encourages more environmentally friendly patterns of production and consumption through a variety of initiatives, such as global agreements and specialized laws governing the handling of environmentally hazardous products. The population is growing continuously but our planet earth is running out of resources. That is why we need to change our consumption habits and shift our energy supplies to more sustainable ones. We as individuals can also develop more environmentally friendly lifestyles which may involve reducing back on consumption, selecting products with less negative effects on the environment, and lowering the carbon footprint of daily activities and also we as a consumer should reduce waste like plastics because plastics is one of the main pollutants of the ocean, instead of using plastics we should use the reusable bags, we should all refuse of using plastics and use the environment friendly products so that we can help for the nature. </h3>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> The dilemma that is linked to the Sdg 12 is balancing the economic growth with environmental sustainability because if the economic activity increases then the demand for energy will also increase which can lead to increased population, so it is important that we should balance the economic growth with the environment sustainability. Even Though economic growth is necessary for improving living standards, reducing poverty and creating jobs, somehow it can lead  to resource depletion, pollution, ecosystem damage, which will  threaten the long term environmental sustainability. Innovative strategies, conscientious regulations, and a change in consumer and corporate behavior are all necessary to achieve a balance between the two goals. Balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability is important for a healthy future for both humanity and the planet and also it is essential to ensure the conservation of resources, maintaining the health of ecosystems, reducing the effects of climate change, and promoting social justice. Sustainability is important for preserving our planet and natural resources like water and air. </h3>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Building a sustainable future and cultivating sustainable ways of living will reduce pollution and protect habitats of plants and animals. Economic activity relies on natural resources and ecosystem services, while environmental damage can disrupt economic activity and lead to higher costs. If we fail to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability it  can lead to consequences like the increase of pollution, biodiversity loss and more. The pollution and scarcity of natural resources can result from the production and use of products. Furthermore, the integration of sustainable practices into economic planning may be hindered by insufficient rules and regulations as well as an emphasis on standard growth indicators. To balance economic growth with environmental sustainability is by implementing policies or laws that support renewable energy  such as tax incentives for eco-friendly technology. Investing in public transportation and eco-friendly infrastructure can enhance mobility and reduce emissions.</h3>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Furthermore, encouraging collaborations between corporations, governments, and communities may promote shared responsibility and innovation, guaranteeing that economic expansion does not compromise the sustainability of the environment. To balance economic growth with environmental sustainability using virtue ethics, we can focus on cultivating a culture of environmental stewardship and responsible citizenship. One of the solutions we can do for this dilemma is to encourage the leaders in business and government to embody moral qualities like responsibility, compassion, and honesty. They can encourage others to do the same by setting an example of sustainable behavior and placing a high priority on long-term ecological health. We should also implement educational programs that promote the importance  of environmental traits like community service and respect for nature. This can empower people to make moral decisions in both their personal and professional life. And also to encourage the community to promote collaborative efforts toward sustainability, like tree planting, clean-up drive, and community sustainability activities.</h3> 
	<h3 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> As a result the communities will become more morally united and responsible. Motivate those businesses to operate with a virtue-based strategy that prioritizes long-term well-being over immediate financial gain. This could entail responsible resource management, waste minimization, and environmentally friendly purchasing. By this we can build a society that considers sustainability as a fundamental value by highlighting characteristics that support environmental protection, which will eventually result in a harmonious balance between economic growth and environmental health. Economic resilience and environmental sustainability are strongly related. Societies may create an economy that is more resilient to environmental shocks and disruptions by encouraging sustainable practices, limiting environmental risks, and conserving natural resources. In conclusion, balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability is necessary to build a happy and sustainable future for the current and the future generations. We can guarantee that economic progress is compatible with the wellbeing of the earth and its inhabitants by putting policies into place that support sustainability and environmental conservation. </h3>
