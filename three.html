	<h3 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, talks about making conscious choices that minimize our negative impact on the environment. SDG 12 emphasizes the importance of sustainable consumption and production patterns to guarantee the well-being of both present and future generations. As populations increase, our planet's resources are becoming depleted at an alarming rate. By reducing our consumption of fossil fuels and adopting more sustainable practices, we can help mitigate the negative impacts of these problems on our planet and communities. </h3>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> An important worldwide issue, the chemical problem presents a serious risk to the environment, human health, and the economy. With hundreds of new compounds being generated yearly, the continuous chemical exploration and expansion has resulted in an unsurpassed development of new chemicals. But the widespread use of chemicals has led to concerns about their potential impacts on the environment and public health. Air, water, and soil have been shown to be contaminated by several chemicals and have also been connected to major health issues including cancer, reproductive difficulties, and developmental abnormalities, which makes it harder to get rid of them from the environment. The issue of waste is important. Waste management is essential for maintaining biodiversity, the environment, and human health, especially when it comes to chemical waste. The appropriate disposal of garbage and hazardous substances is an essential part of waste management. If not managed properly, these substances can have severe impacts on human health and ecosystems. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) portrays the need to develop sustainable patterns of production and consumption, which includes reducing waste creation and properly disposing of hazardous materials. </h3>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Consequentialism aims to support sustainable chemistry which involves producing and utilizing eco-friendly chemicals that reduce harm to people and the environment. To achieve this, we give awareness and knowledge to individuals who are unaware of the situation that we are currently in; Giving them knowledge about the environmental state and using eco-friendly chemicals to minimize harm to ecosystems and human health, we must also make sure that chemicals are disposed of in an environmentally appropriate manner. By considering the effects of our actions, we can create a system that puts the well-being of people and the environment ahead of short-term benefits. It is to give attention to safer substitutes, use less chemicals, and take biodegradable materials into consideration. People can help create a more sustainable future by implementing these practices. This strategy encourages the creation and application of chemicals that are sustainable, safe, and effective, which eventually improves the situation for everyone. Recycling and reusing of materials as a means of decreasing the amount of garbage thrown in landfills is an essential factor of waste management. Besides reducing greenhouse gas emissions related to trash disposal, this helps preserve natural resources. As a way reduce waste and encourage resource efficiency, the SDGs place a strong emphasis on these two areas.</h3>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Individuals must engage in mindful consumption by being conscious of their consumption patterns and avoiding unnecessary purchases, which will promote caution and frugality in decision-making for sustainability. To reduce waste and save resources, they could include the 3Rs: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle into their everyday lives. People have the option to purchase sustainable goods and select products that have a minimal environmental effect and composed of sustainable resources. By making minimal everyday changes to lower their energy and water usage, people may preserve both resources. Businesses can play a crucial role in promoting sustainability by implementing distribution practices, sourcing materials and products from environmentally responsible suppliers. Through the execution of recycling programs, packaging reduction, and carbon footprint minimization, they may also cut waste and emissions. By establishing sustainable distribution procedures and procuring materials and goods from suppliers that practice environmental responsibility, businesses may play a key role in supporting sustainability. Through the execution of recycling programs, packaging reduction, and carbon footprint minimization, they may also cut waste and emissions. In an attempt to lower consumption of energy, businesses can also switch to energy-efficient equipment and processes and invest in energy-efficient technology. Furthermore, companies have the ability to create environmentally friendly products and services that are much sustainable. Increasing producer responsibility is one example of a policy that policymakers could implement to encourage sustainable consumption habits. In addition, they can promote the development of sustainable equipment by making investments in environmentally friendly facilities such as waste management facilities and renewable energy systems. By informing the public about the value of sustainability and offering resources to encourage sustainable living, policymakers can also increase knowledge and awareness among the general population. Laws created that support sustainable manufacturing methods, such those that lower waste and pollution, can be put into place to support environmental sustainability. </h3>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Individuals, businesses, and politicians can work together to create a sustainable future, lessen environmental damage, and guarantee a healthy world for coming generations by putting these proposals into practice. By decreasing waste and pollution, protecting natural resources, advancing sustainable manufacturing methods, and fostering responsible spending habits. We can all contribute to a healthier environment by developing a sustainable mentality and putting these suggestions into practice.</h3>
