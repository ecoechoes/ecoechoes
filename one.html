		<h2 style="text-align: center;"> The Burden We Breathe </h2>
		<h3 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> The Philippines faces a growing garbage crisis that seems increasingly insurmountable. A telling example of this issue is found in Southville 6, a government resettlement site in Calamba City, Laguna. Just a few kilometers southeast of Metro Manila, the community lies in the shadow of a sprawling landfill that no amount of sanitation citations has been able to close permanently. </h3>
		<h3 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right:20px"> For residents like Rechiel Antones, who has lived in Southville 6 for 11 years, the landfill is more than just an eyesore. It’s a source of daily torment, especially when she was pregnant in 2023. The stench from the trash heaps, which stretch dangerously close to her neighborhood, overwhelmed her senses, contributing to severe nausea during her pregnancy. Antones recalls the odor so intense that no amount of shielding, even burying her head under a pillow, could keep it at bay. “It feels like the landfill is right next to you,” she explains, frustrated by the smell that assaulted her home, making her head pound in agony. </h3>
		<h3 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px"> Beyond the immediate discomfort, there’s a much larger issue. The landfill, operated by SB Hain Enterprises and General Services Inc., occupies a 6.6-hectare plot and violates government regulations, which state that no landfill should be within 250 meters of residential areas. Yet, for the residents of Southville 6, the garbage has crept far too close for comfort. A flimsy wall of “yero” (galvanized iron sheets) separates homes from the piles of waste, but it’s hardly enough to protect the community from the growing mountain of trash. Aerial footage posted on social media reveals the grim reality—households at the foot of a stinking, hazardous waste mountain, far too close for the community to feel safe or healthy. </h3>
		<h3 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px"> This situation isn’t just an environmental disaster; it’s a human-induced disorder, both physical and moral. The contributors of this trash are, after all, humans—businesses, households, and individuals who continuously dump waste without considering its impact. But the moral disorder lies deeper. People know the consequences of improper garbage disposal, yet many choose inaction. They are fully aware of how their carelessness can pollute neighborhoods, poison ecosystems, and threaten public health. However, rather than act, they ignore the looming catastrophe, hoping someone else will clean up the mess. </h3>
		<h3 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> The landfill in Southville 6 is a painful reminder of this collective negligence. The foul odor is not just a nuisance, but a symbol of a society that has failed to care for the environment or for each other. If people continue to dismiss their responsibility toward proper waste management, the garbage problem will only grow, suffocating communities like Southville 6 under mountains of waste—both literal and moral. </h3>
		<h3 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> But the situation is not beyond hope. If human choices have brought us to this point, then better choices can lead us out. The key lies in collective action, starting with the enforcement of waste disposal laws and the creation of stricter policies to prevent landfills from poisoning residential areas. This can only happen if individuals and communities unite in raising awareness about the critical importance of waste management. It is essential to educate people on the impact their actions have on the environment, urging them to take personal responsibility for their waste—whether through segregation, recycling, or proper disposal. </h3>
		<h3 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Beyond awareness, there must be a shift in mindset—a move from indifference to accountability. The garbage crisis is not someone else's problem; it belongs to all of us. In schools, workplaces, and neighborhoods, communities must work together to reduce, reuse, and recycle. Innovative solutions, such as waste-to-energy projects, can transform trash into resources, but only if people are willing to embrace these changes and adapt. </h3>
		<h3 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Effective waste management is not merely a government task—it requires everyone’s participation. By taking small, consistent steps, we can prevent the creation of new "stinking mountains" of waste. People like Rechiel Antones should not have to suffer in their own homes. If we act now, we can create cleaner, safer environments, and build a future where landfills are managed responsibly, and our neighborhoods are free from the stench of neglect. In doing so, we not only protect our environment but restore a sense of moral order to our actions—choosing to care for the world and for one another. </h3>
